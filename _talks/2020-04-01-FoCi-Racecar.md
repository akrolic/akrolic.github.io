Abstract:

In this project, through hands-on experience, undergraduate students at Clemson University studied
the new frontier of autonomous control for off-road vehicles. A team of 8 students from the Mechanical
Engineering, Industrial Engineering, and Computer Science departments worked as a team in designing
and testing a tracked off-road vehicle. This project required students to develop a research vehicle that
could autonomously traverse over a rugged off-road environment. The students learned by experimenting
with different hardware configurations and coding control algorithms by themselves. In the first iteration,
students used only a lidar sensor to map and localize the tank within its environment simultaneously. They
worked with adapting the low-level motor controller to the path planning algorithm to accurately control the
tank through adverse situations such as a cluttered environment under snow weather. In a second iteration,
students combined the lidar sensor with a stereo camera to improve the accuracy of the path planning. The
introduction of a camera also enabled students to use computer vision techniques to detect objects and
make decisions based on the surrounding environment. Capability of aerial-ground coordination between
unmanned MAV and the tracked vehicle will also be demonstrated. This project provides students the
opportunity to explore several end-to-end training solutions for controlling autonomous ground vehicles in a
variety of environments, which will prepare students for future industries and careers in AI.
