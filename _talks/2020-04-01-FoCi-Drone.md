Abstract:

Electric-powered Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) technologies are around the corner and ready
to be applied to commercial applications, such as unmanned delivery, emergence response, survey and
patrolling, etc. Autonomous control of an Unmanned Air Vehicle for a package delivery mission is specifically
considered in this project. The objective of this project is to design, simulate, and test a UAV to perform
package delivery missions solely based on vision navigation and autonomous control techniques. This
presentation will emphasize the simulation technique developed during this study. A “hardware-in-the-loop”
testing approach was adopted. The control board and radio controller were connected to a virtual testing
environment to interact with different test conditions. Dynamic response feedback can be used for testing
different autonomous control algorithms. The hands-on programming and testing practices can also be
applied to many other interdisciplinary projects such as self-driving car researches.
