Abstract:

Electric-powered Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) technologies are around the corner and ready
to be applied to commercial applications, such as unmanned delivery, emergency response, survey
and patrolling, etc. Autonomous control of an Unmanned Air Vehicle for a package delivery mission
is specifically considered in this project. Students in the first project will showcase their customized
drone build and also the computer simulation environment for vision-based navigation model training.
The objective of this project is to design, simulate and test a UAV to perform package delivery mission
solely based on vision navigation and autonomous control techniques. This presentation will emphasize
the simulation technique developed during this study. A “hardware-in-the-loop” testing approach was
adopted. The control board and radio controller were connected to a virtual testing environment to
interact with different test conditions. Dynamic response feedback can be used for testing different
autonomous control algorithms. The hands-on programming and testing practices can also be applied
to many other interdisciplinary projects such as self-driving car researches. The second project involves a
technical display of a fully-autonomous 18th scale racecar finishing racing on a track. Guests can also try
to control the racecar using a joystick and compete with the trained AI model.
