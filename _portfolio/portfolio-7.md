I worked at MTU Rolls Royce Power Systems in Aiken, SC as a test engineer in the research and development division for three semesters (1 year). I enjoyed working in the engine test cell, working with emissions measurement equipment, performing EPA engine certification testing, and learning how to process large-scale measurement data from hundreds of sensors on the test stand. Due to my technical readiness and leadership maturity, I took on the challenge of leading my own engine development project on a 3.5 MW 20-cylinder diesel generator engine. I successfully reduced hydrocarbon emissions by 50% without increasing NOx or CO emissions using proprietary engine control strategies. I personally performed the parent engine EPA certification tests and completed the project within the proposed timeline. I learned valuable lessons during this experience, test engineering can be unforgiving, and learning how to manage time, costs, and equipment helped me grow as a professional engineer.

I am bound to a non-disclosure agreement and cannot discuss any specific details of my technical work and achievements beyond the non-confidential information provided above.
