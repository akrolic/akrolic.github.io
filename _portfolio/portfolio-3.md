Work in progress...

Multiple events and competitions have recognized my research work. My team participated in the F1TENTH International Federation of Controls Conference virtual head-to-head autonomous racing competition in the summer of 2020 and placed in the top 5 in our first year. I worked with my teammates to build our own prototype ground vehicles for deploying and validating the performance of our algorithms using powerful onboard computers with GPU accelerated programs. I helped our team in every stage of development and taught new members how to get started with little to no background experience. We formed the Clemson University Autonomous Systems Team (CAST) and participated in the Clemson Covid Challenge, where we proposed a multi-agent autonomous delivery solution that won the Clemson Covid Challenge Excellence Prize. Our work was selected to be a finalist for South Carolina's InnoVision Award in the Covid-19 Response category.
