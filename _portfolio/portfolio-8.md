Our design team met with engineers at the Spartanburg, SC plant to familiarize ourself with the customers needs and functional requirements associated with the project. The objective was to automate a process, and increase the total product throughput by reducing cycle time. We derived the requirements, met with the customer to perform design reviews and cover solution concepts. We provided a detailed design 3D model assembly of our final solution, with the full bill of materials and a verification and validation plan. 

At a high level, this automated system involved robotic arms, pnuematics, conveyors, and advanced material removal technology.
