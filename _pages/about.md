My name is Alexander Krolicki and I graduated from Clemson University the department of [Mechanical Engineering](https://www.clemson.edu/cecas/departments/me/) with my Bachelor of Science in 2020 and Masters of Science in 2022.

My undergraduate advisor was [Dr. Yiqiang Han](https://www.clemson.edu/cecas/departments/me/people/faculty/han.html) and under his direction I lead the [Clemson Autonomous Systems Team](https://clemson-autonomous-systems.gitbook.io/clemson-university-autonomous-systems/) (CAST). 

My graduate advisor was [Dr. Umesh Vaidya](https://www.clemson.edu/cecas/departments/me/people/faculty/Vaidya.html) and I helped create the [Distributed Intelligence and Robot Autonomy Lab](https://cecas.clemson.edu/ugvaidya/home/) (DIRA). 

My primary research interests are Koopman operator theory, nonlinear optimal control, and autonomous robotic systems. My major theoretical contributions in the field of dynamic systems and nonlinear optimal control are summarized in my thesis "[Koopman Operator Theory and The Applied Perspective of Modern Data-Driven Systems](https://tigerprints.clemson.edu/all_theses/3941/)".
