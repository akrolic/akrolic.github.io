My name is Alexander Krolicki and I graduated from Clemson University the department of [Mechanical Engineering](https://www.clemson.edu/cecas/departments/me/) with my Bachelor of Science in 2020 and Masters of Science in 2022.

My undergraduate advisor was [Dr. Yiqiang Han](https://www.clemson.edu/cecas/departments/me/people/faculty/han.html) and under his direction I lead the [Clemson Autonomous Systems Team](https://clemson-autonomous-systems.gitbook.io/clemson-university-autonomous-systems/) (CAST). 

My graduate advisor was [Dr. Umesh Vaidya](https://www.clemson.edu/cecas/departments/me/people/faculty/Vaidya.html) and I helped create the [Distributed Intelligence and Robot Autonomy Lab](https://cecas.clemson.edu/ugvaidya/home/) (DIRA). 

My primary research interests are Koopman operator theory, nonlinear optimal control, and autonomous robotic systems. My major theoretical contributions in the field of dynamic systems and nonlinear optimal control are summarized in my thesis "[Koopman Operator Theory and The Applied Perspective of Modern Data-Driven Systems](https://tigerprints.clemson.edu/all_theses/3941/)". 

I am a firm believer in open-source projects, and have learned from many great projects in the past, such as:
* [NVIDIA Redtail](https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT/redtail)
* [F1TENTH](https://f1tenth.org/)
* [Stanford Doggo](https://github.com/Nate711/StanfordDoggoProject)
* [Stanford Pupper](https://pupper-independent-study.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

A project that I am currently working on is the development of TerraBot, and in house design by DIRA lab member and MSME student [Dakota Rufino](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dakota-rufino-266277159) that is an extension of the Stanford Pupper which is capable of autonomous navigation using strictly onboard compute and sensors. If its not edge computing, then its not autonomous!

Another project that I am also working on is the development of a wheel-legged version of Stanford Doggo, or as we call our robot "Clemson Tigger". I am helping mentor undergraduate [Jackson Erb](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jackson-erb-327b01207) in the design, construction, and testing of a mechanism which is able to fit within the existing output shaft configuration. Once complete, we will open source the design, code, and results on github to contribute to this project. 

I am in the process of updating this webpage to include my official, and unofficial works completed during my time at Clemson University. So stay tuned for more updates to come!
