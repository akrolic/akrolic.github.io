My name is Alexander Krolicki and I graduated from Clemson University the department of [Mechanical Engineering](https://www.clemson.edu/cecas/departments/me/) with my Bachelor of Science in 2020 and Masters of Science in 2022.

My graduate advisor was [Umesh Vaidya](https://www.clemson.edu/cecas/departments/me/people/faculty/Vaidya.html) and I helped create the [Distributed Intelligence and Robot Autonomy Lab](https://cecas.clemson.edu/ugvaidya/home/). 

My primary research interests are Koopman operator theory, nonlinear optimal control, and autonomous robotic systems.
